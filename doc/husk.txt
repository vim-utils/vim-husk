*husk.txt*	Mappings that boost vim command line mode.

Author: Bruno Sutic <https://www.github.com/bruno->

INTRODUCTION					*husk*

Mappings that boost vim command line mode. The goal is to have mappings
similar to bash emacs mode. You can read more about this idea in |tcsh-style|.

Plugin killer feature are <M-f> and <M-b> CLI mappings that move one "word"
right or left (notice the lowercase "word"). This is an enhancement from
vanilla vim that enables only "WORD" (uppercase) left or right with
|c_<S-Left>| and |<S-Right>|.

MAPS						*husk-maps*

All mappings are defined only in vim's command line mode.

						*husk-CTRL-A*
<C-a>		Cursor to beginning of command line, same as |c_CTRL-B|.

						*husk-CTRL-F*
<C-f>		Cursor right, same as |c_<Right>|. Falls back to
		|c_CTRL-F| at the end of the line.

						*husk-CTRL-B*
<C-b>		Cursor left, same as |c_<Left>|.

						*husk-CTRL-D*
<C-d>		Delete character after the cursor. Falls back to
		|c_CTRL-D| at the end of the line.

						*husk-META-F*
<M-f>		Cursor one "word" right. Command line equivalent of |w| for
		normal mode.

						*husk-META-B*
<M-b>		Cursor one "word" left. Command line equivalent of |b| for
		normal mode.

						*husk-META-D*
<M-d>		Delete "word" after the cursor. Command line equivalent of
		'dw' for normal mode.

						*husk-META-BS*
<M-BS>		Delete "word" before the cursor. Same as |c_CTRL-W|.
